# Hyperparameter Optimization

Based on the [blog](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/03/01/optimisation-and-training-techniques-for-deep-learning/), this repo is meant to be a testing platform for Hyperparameter optimization.

The goal will be to make this as generic as possible and to provide a "testing harness" to allow anyone to use run hyperparameter optimization.

## TODO
1. ~~Param limits (min/max)~~


## Running


## Notes

Params are specified min,max,runningValue
- i.e. parameter.myparam=0,5,3

final params are specified runningValue
final.parameter.myparamfinal=3
